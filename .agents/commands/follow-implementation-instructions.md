# Follow Implementation Instructions

Start implementing each phase one by one. Implement feedback loops as needed. Follow Code Style Guidelines.

For each phase:

- split the phase into logical steps
- implement one phase at a time
- after phase is completed, review if the plan can be improved, and improve it
- commit (empty commit if needed) once each phase is implemented

For each step of the phase:

- use separate sub-agent as needed
- come with plan and implement it
- commit each step with a summary of the changes
- afterwards check if the plan can be further improved, apply improvements before moving on to next step

Use sub-agents sequentially as needed. Consult Oracle for feedback.
