# Feature Planning

Manage work-item planning from rough intent through optional context, implementation-ready plan, and paste-ready prompt for a fresh implementation thread.

## Workflow Overview

```text
Work Item → Context as needed → Plan → Refine → Handoff Prompt → Implement → Record Progress
```

1. **Work item**: Use `agent-work` to create or locate `.agents/work/<category>/<work-slug>/`.
2. **Context**: Add `research.md` for technical facts, `research/` for multiple focused notes, or `prd.md` as a short requirements brief only when needed.
3. **Plan**: Create or update the active plan file (`plan.md` by default, or `plans/<name>.md` for focused plans) with scoped tasks, dependencies, and acceptance criteria.
4. **Refine**: Validate assumptions against current repo reality before implementation.
5. **Handoff prompt**: Produce a paste-ready prompt for the next implementation thread.
6. **Progress**: The implementation thread updates active plan task checkboxes, `progress.md`, and `index.md`.

## Plan Locations

New plans live inside work items:

```text
.agents/work/<category>/<work-slug>/
├── index.md
├── research.md
├── research/
├── prd.md
├── plan.md
├── plans/
├── progress.md
└── decisions/
```

Legacy standalone plan and PRD documents are user content. Migrate one at a time into `.agents/work/` only when requested. Retired Ralph guidance/templates may be backed up and removed by sync.

## Requirements Brief Guidance

Most work does not need a PRD. Create `prd.md` only when the missing context is requirements alignment: users, behavior, goals, non-goals, acceptance, rollout, or stakeholder decisions. Use the [agent-work requirements brief template](../agent-work/assets/prd-template.md).

Use `research.md` or `research/` for technical discovery. If acceptance criteria fit naturally in the active plan file, skip `prd.md`.

## Plan Guidance

Use the [agent-work plan template](../agent-work/assets/plan-template.md). Keep plans implementation-ready:

- Each task has `Scope`, `Depends on`, and verifiable `Acceptance`.
- The next task or phase is obvious.
- Scope limits and verification commands are explicit when not obvious.
- Blockers, manual steps, and risky assumptions are called out.
- Tasks are small enough to review independently.

For larger work, prefer an early thin slice that proves the end-to-end path before broad hardening.

## Pre-Implementation Refinement

Use this before writing a handoff prompt when work is multi-phase, ambiguous, or stale.

1. Read the work item's `index.md` and active plan file (`plan.md` or `plans/<name>.md` as linked from `index.md`).
2. Read relevant `research.md`, requirements brief (`prd.md`), and decisions only as needed.
3. Validate key assumptions against current code, dependencies, and test setup.
4. Resolve material open questions with repo evidence where possible; ask the user only for decisions the repo cannot answer.
5. If a planned task is already satisfied, record evidence and update the active plan file instead of creating no-op work.
6. Update the active plan file, `progress.md`, and `index.md` when refinement changes the next action or known constraints.

Skip the full pass for small, obvious changes where the plan and repo state are already aligned.

## New-Thread Handoff Prompt

Use this mode when asked to write a prompt for a new thread, implementation handoff, or continuation. Produce a paste-ready prompt; do not implement the work yourself unless the user explicitly asks.

The prompt should include:

1. Work item path.
2. Files to read first.
3. Goal and current state.
4. Exact task, phase, or slice to implement.
5. Scope limits and non-goals.
6. Artifact update contract for the active plan file, `progress.md`, and `index.md`.
7. Verification commands or manual checks.
8. Stop conditions.
9. Expected final response format.

Use this template:

```text
You are continuing the work item at:

.agents/work/<category>/<slug>/

Read first:
1. .agents/work/<category>/<slug>/index.md
2. <active plan file linked from index.md: .agents/work/<category>/<slug>/plan.md or .agents/work/<category>/<slug>/plans/<name>.md>
3. Relevant artifacts linked from index.md

Goal:
<one-paragraph goal>

Current state:
<what is already done, plus branch/commit/thread anchors if useful>

Implement only this slice:
- <Task N / phase / exact acceptance criteria>

Scope limits:
- Touch only <paths/modules> unless the plan proves the scope is wrong.
- Do not broaden the feature.
- If the plan is stale, update the plan and explain why before implementing.

Progress contract:
- Update completed task checkboxes in the active plan file.
- Append or update progress.md with changes, verification, blockers, and next action.
- Update index.md Status, Updated, Artifacts, and Next Action when they change.

Verification:
- Run <commands>.
- If verification cannot run, record why and what remains unverified.

Stop conditions:
- Stop and report if blocked by missing decisions, credentials, unsafe migrations, unrelated failing tests, or scope expansion.

Expected final response:
- Summary of changes
- Files changed
- Verification results
- Work item updates made
- Remaining next action
```

## Stress-Test Mode

Use this only when the user explicitly asks to stress-test, grill, or walk decision branches.

1. Inspect the existing PRD, plan, repo docs, and relevant code first.
2. Ask one highest-leverage unresolved question at a time.
3. Provide a recommended default answer and brief rationale for each question.
4. Capture outcomes in `prd.md`, the active plan file, or `index.md`.
5. Exit once remaining ambiguity no longer materially changes scope, sequencing, or architecture.

## Definition Of Done

Planning is done when the work item has a current `index.md`, required context artifacts, an implementation-ready active plan file, and either a clear next action or a paste-ready handoff prompt.
