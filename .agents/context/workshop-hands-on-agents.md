I am preparing a workshop and I would like to have a post with slides, it last 30 minutes or so. Should be in a simple format where I would share the outline of what could be done in this time, with simple steps to follow. Also some intro. And some resources to dive deeper at the end

Topic: Hands on Agents

I would like to make it fun and informative.

Here I present the following repo: <https://github.com/colmarius/dot-agents>

I would like to help the participants to set it up on a personal projects of theirs, with a short guide on how to do that.

First part:

1. 20% – Intro to Amp my personal coding agent, philosopy, where it differs from other agent, some links to Signup to Ampcode.com page and manual and link to <https://www.buildcrew.team/> where they can get a $100 discount. Amp has a free tier, with adds, $10 free a day.

2. 40% – Main workshop part of setting up the dot-agents project

3. 20% – Example of using agents in a production codebase just reminder of showing this

4. Some resources and space for discussion, Q & A

Think what is the best way to achieve this given existing structure in the repo for blog/posts/contents, or if we need something else.
