    "description": "Beyang Liu discusses Sourcegraph's Amp agent and the shift in software engineering from coding to orchestrating agents, where 90% of time is spent on code review. Topics include the 'Smart' vs 'Fast' agent architecture, the rise of Chinese open source models for agentic tool use, and the transition to probabilistic software where developers manage intent while agents handle implementation logic.",

    "description": "Beyang Liu explores the evolution of AI coding agents from co-pilots to autonomous tools, covering controversial design decisions (autonomous edits, minimal UI, model coupling), Amp's implementation, and power user insights. Discusses best practices like detailed prompts, feedback loops, and sub-agents for complex tasks, while highlighting anti-patterns including micromanaging and underprompting.",

    "description": "An eight-part documentary series chronicling Sourcegraph's development of Amp, revealing groundbreaking insights on building practical coding agents. Topics include the shift from prompt to context engineering, the power of autonomous feedback loops, sub-agent architectures for context management, the \"Oracle\" pattern for multi-model reasoning, why codebases must adapt to agents, and evaluating LLM capabilities across providers. The team demonstrates why success depends on model quality over hidden tricks, treating agents as power tools rather than magic wands.",
