## Welcome

This is the first post on my new blog. I'll be writing about coding with AI agents, software engineering, and other technical topics.

### What to Expect

I'm planning to write a series of posts covering:

- Introduction to coding with AI agents
- Core concepts and patterns
- Practical examples and use cases
- Best practices and lessons learned

### Testing Code Blocks

Here's a simple code example to test syntax highlighting:

```typescript
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

const message = greet('World');
console.log(message);
```

### Testing Lists

**Unordered list:**

- First item
- Second item
- Third item with **bold text**

**Ordered list:**

1. Start here
2. Then this
3. Finally that

### More Content

This post is just testing the rendering capabilities. Real content coming soon!

Stay tuned for more posts about AI-assisted development, patterns for working with coding agents, and practical examples from real projects.
