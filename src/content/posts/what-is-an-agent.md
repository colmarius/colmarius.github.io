Inspired by [Simon Willison's definition](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/18/agents/)—"LLMs calling tools in a loop to achieve a goal"—this post keeps things simple and practical. If you remember one thing about agents, make it this: **an agent is a loop that thinks, acts with tools, observes, and repeats until done.**

## What is an Agent?

- An agent uses an LLM to decide what to do next
- It can call **tools** (functions/APIs/scripts) to act in the world
- It runs in a loop: think → act → observe → decide → repeat, guided by a goal

## The Core Loop

```text
goal → think → choose_tool → call_tool → observe_result
    → decide: done? otherwise refine plan and loop
```

    Start([Goal]) --> Think[Think: Analyze situation]
    Think --> Choose[Choose Tool]
    Choose --> Call[Call Tool]
    Call --> Observe[Observe Result]
    Observe --> Decide{Goal Reached?}
    Decide -->|No| Think
    Decide -->|Yes| End([Done])

    style Observe fill:#1a1a1a,stroke:#9C27B0,color:#fff
    style Decide fill:#1a1a1a,stroke:#F44336,color:#fff
```

## Tools an Agent Can Call

- **Files:** read/write files, list directories
- **Code:** run a snippet (e.g., Python/TypeScript) or a test
- **HTTP/APIs:** fetch JSON, call app backends, web search
- **Data:** query a database or vector index
- **System:** shell commands or task runners (with guardrails)

## A Quick Example

**Goal:** "Turn expenses.csv into a bar chart of monthly totals."

1. **Think:** "I need to read the file, group by month, and plot."
2. **Act:** Call `file.read('expenses.csv')` → observe rows
3. **Think:** "I'll write and run a small Python snippet."
4. **Act:** Call `code.run(python, script)` → observe a PNG path
5. **Decide:** Goal reached → return "Chart saved at charts/monthly.png"

> **Task:** Watch an agent think, act, and verify in your own codebase
>
> **Prompt:**
>
> ```text
> Read package.json, list all dependencies, and create a summary
> markdown file called deps-summary.md with total count.
> ```
>
> **Verification:**
>
> - Check that deps-summary.md was created
> - Verify the dependency count matches package.json
>
> **Expected outcome:** You'll see the agent read the file, count dependencies, create a new file, and confirm it worked—the core loop in action.

## When Does the Loop Stop?

- **Goal reached:** the result satisfies the instruction
- **Safety limits:** max steps/tokens/time reached
- **Stuck:** repeated failures or no progress detected
- **User stop:** human cancels or asks for partial results

## Why This Matters

- **Moves beyond chat:** the LLM can actually *do* things via tools
- **Robustness via iteration:** adjust after each observation
- **Composability:** clear, testable tools keep agents maintainable
- **Safety by design:** constrain tools, log actions, cap loops

## Quick FAQ

**Q: How is an agent different from ChatGPT or Copilot?**
A: ChatGPT gives you text responses. Copilot suggests code. Agents run tools in a loop—they read files, run tests, see results, and iterate until the goal is met.

**Q: What if the agent makes a mistake?**
A: Review diffs, stage good changes, discard bad ones. Git is your safety net.

**Q: Can agents write entire apps?**
A: They excel at focused tasks with clear goals. Think "fix this bug and verify" not "build me Instagram."
