                      I am a software developer from Milan passioned about <em>web development</em> and <em>software-as-a-service</em> solutions. I prefer writing <em>clean</em> and <em>modular code</em> to get the job done.

                      I believe &ldquo;less is more&rdquo;, a piece of code is not perfect when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing more to take from it.

                      I use the <a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com/" target="_blank">Pomodoro technique</a> to organise myself and get things done on a daily basis.

                      It might surprise some... I Love to work with Legacy code! Where others see a Problem I see an Opportunity.

                      In my spare time I like to learn new technologies and build small and useful projects.
